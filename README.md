# GSTBillingApplication
Dear friends!
We are working on an open source GST billing Web Application in Asp.Net. All the developers are invited who is willing to join us in the development process of this web-application. 

About the Application
-----------------------------
This is a simple billing application where user can create GST Invoice online. The basic functionality has been added in the application like registering the company with company profile, Creating products categories and adding products, creating customers and finally creating invoices for its clients. So all of the merchants are well aware of the work flow of the application and can easily be adoped by its users. It is self developed so it is not complicated like tally or busy and can be customized and tailored as per the client requirements.
The application will be developed in various faces. So if is a great chance for a beginner to learn all the concepts of a dynamic web-based project from front-end designing to complete coding in C# with Asp.Net. 
The previous version of this billing package is a desktop version and already running to many clinets but they are also demanding that they require an online system or web-based system so that they can check/create invoice any time from anywhere from a centralized system. That's why we have started this project. 
Some of the features of the application is: Online billing, centraized data storage and security, Accessible on mobile devices(billing on the way), SMS and Email Invoice
We also invites experts to co-ordinates with us in the development and further enhancement of this project for market implementation as some of our clients already using the previous version of this application.
